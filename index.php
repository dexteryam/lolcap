              <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <h4>This website is a personal project of Dexter Yam. It is a site where you can use a stencil to create your own League of Legends character. The purpose of this website is to foster creative and innovative
            ideas for new League of Legends champions. Through user-submitted content and collaborative efforts (WIP), many exciting and interesting new champion ideas may spawn. And if any actual Riot designers
            like any Champion ideas, they are more than welcome to use any ideas originating from this website.</h4>
